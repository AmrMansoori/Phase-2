**DANEILO MCDONALD CONTRIBUTION**
I created the Checkout page along with all the associated javascript and css that are on said page.
I made the page in such a way that it incorporates javascript functions for the calculation of the items bought.
The quantity of the items can be increased or decreaded.
A customer will be able to add mulitple items at a time using the "Add Item" button or remove an item that they no longer wish to purchase using the "Remove" button.
If the customer has a promo code, then they would be able to get either $10 off on their items or 10% depending on wether they have the "SAVE10" (10% off) or "10OFF" ($10 off) promo codes.
Then they would click the "Apply" button to get the discount deducted from their receipt.
After this they would click the "Place Your Order" button to be billed their receipt. 
An alert will then pop up with the receipt and a thank you message.
